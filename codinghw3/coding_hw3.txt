Results:
Problem 1: 
Resnet18 without normalization: 0.4456
Resnet18 with normalization: 0.6696

Problem 2:
Resnet 18 with fivecrop, with normalization: 0.7292
We cannot use tencrop for photos that have words read from left to right, for example street signs and car plate numbers

Problem 3:
Here we use the latest master version of torchvision, which already implements adaptive average pool
To download it use `pip install git+https://github.com/pytorch/vision.git`
Resnet with 330x330 images, with normalization: 0.6984
